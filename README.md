A collection of small C++ classes for interacting with hardware IO (buttons, LEDs, sensors, etc) via Open Sound Control. 

Developed for the Raspberry Pi but could be made to work on other embedded Linux platforms. It depends only on wiringPi for controlling hardware and liblo for procsessing OSC messages.
